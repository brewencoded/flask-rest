# Flask-rest
### An simple rest api built in python
**Prequisites:**

1.  Install python 3 [Get it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Check if it installed correctly by typing (cmd/terminal): `python3` you should get a python repl. type `exit()` to leave the repl. 
2.   Install pip:
     * Mac: comes with python3. chould be able to check by typing `pip3 --version` from terminal
     * Linux: both python 2 and 3 come by default on newer linux. pip may need to be isntall via `sudo-apt-get install python3-pip`
     * Windows: 
3.  Install any text editor:
    * [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Sublime Text](https://dbader.org/blog/setting-up-sublime-text-for-python-development), and [Atom](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python) are all great for this. **I highly recommend Atom or PyCharm for people who don't like configuring an editor.**

**Install Project**

1.  from the command line or git gui, clone the repository: https://github.com/full-stakk/flask-rest.git
2.  cd into the directory from command line
3.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
4.  Use venv:
    * Mac/Linux: `source fr/bin/activate` (to leave a virtual environment type `deactivate`)
5.  Install dependencies into virtual environment: 
    * Mac/Linux: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `pip freeze` should show a list of dependencies installed
